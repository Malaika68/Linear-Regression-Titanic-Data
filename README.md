# Linear-Regression-Titanic-Data
The dataset that we are going to use is Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster. The description and details of the data is given on https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic#description from where you can download the data.
Things I have done:
1. Used different variants/ combinations to get the best representation of the data.
2. Gradient Descent : fitted linear regression parameters θ to the dataset provided.
3. Plotted J(θ) with varying learning rate.
4. Redo steps for Multivariate Linear regression.
